<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Sarrick, some of my friends call me 'Big Bird', and some others 'Ceviche' like the dish(I dont smell like fish). I have been training Muay-Thai for 6 years. Muay-Thai has built me up from the ground. To say that it has saved my life is an understatement. This page is a tribute to the journey and people that I now call my family. They have taught me everything about myself that I love, the things about my old ways that I didn't like, and more importantly how truly beautiful other people can be. Muay-Thai has given me adventures I would've never imagined, Values I will never lose, and a life I would never trade away.</p>
